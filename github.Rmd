This class is hosted on GitHub, and we will use the `git` program and GitHub accounts
to distribute lecture notes and homework assignments.
We talked about RStudio, git and GitHub in class, but to review:

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an interface to R, with support for git and GitHub integration
* `git` is a program for version control (mostly useful for plain text documents) 
* GitHub and BitBucket are websites/companies which host `git` repositories 

As of the writing of this document, GitHub offers free public repositories, 
while BitBucket offers free public or private repositories. GitHub seems to
be more popular for open source projects.

You can start a `git` repository (repo) by either *cloning* an existing repo
(as you will do for this course, `compbio`), or *initializing* a repo
from scratch. 

We want to clone the course repo in RStudio, but first, we may need to 
install or upgrade the software on your computer. We need to do the following
steps:

* Install/upgrade R (to version 3.4)
* Install RStudio for Desktop (free)
* Install git
* Hook RStudio up to use git

The first step can be done by visiting [CRAN](cran.r-project.org), and
clicking the appropriate link for your operating system. When you load R,
you want it to say that R is version 3.4 when you type `sessionInfo()`
(`3.4.0` or `3.4.1` is fine).

The second step can be done by visiting the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) website.

The third and fourth step are best accomplished by following the instructions
at the [happygitwithr](http://happygitwithr.com/) website. You do not
need a free private repo for this course. You will just be cloning from the
class repo but not pushing homework back to the repo, instead you will email 
me your completed homeworks. You do not need to complete all of the steps
at *happygitwithr*, only:  installing git and introduce yourself to git. 
If, for other research projects, you are
interested in using GitHub for version control,
you can follow the rest of the instructions on HTTPS or SSH credentials,
but this is not necessary just to clone the class repo.

This class has two "views"  you might say. 
The [HTML/website version](https://mikelove.github.io/compbio/) and the 
[GitHub version](https://github.com/mikelove/compbio). From the GitHub version,
you can poke around, and click on files, even see the history of the code.
If you want to look at the raw text for an Rmd or HTML file, you 
can click the **Raw** link on the top of the document.

To clone the class repo, you should go to the GitHub version of this class 
and look for a green link that says "Clone or download". 
You should copy the link that appears to the clipboard.

Now, open RStudio, and follow the menu items: 
*File > New Project > Version Control > Git*. 
You will paste the link from the previous step into the box that 
says "repository URL". You can set the project directory name to `compbio`.

Following this, you should see a number of `Rmd` and `html` files in the Files 
panel on the lower right hand side. And there will be a git tab in the top right
panel. The git tab will allow you to **pull** down new material as the course goes
on and homeworks are posted to the course repo.
