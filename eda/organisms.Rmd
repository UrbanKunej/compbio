In this document, we will explore a small table of data about
the genomes of various organisms. I also include a file, 
`scrape_ensembl.R` which shows how I scraped this data
from the [Ensembl](http://ensembl.org) website.

We start by reading in the TSV (tab-separated value) data
using the readr package:

```{r}
library(readr)
orgs <- read_tsv("organisms_genes.tsv")
head(orgs)
table(orgs$type)
```

`read_tsv` returns a *tibble* object, which is similar to a
*data.frame*, being tabular data with different types of variables
as columns (character, double, integer, etc.). One difference, aside
from the presentation when you `show` the object, is that the
characters are not automatically converted to *factor*, as they are
with `read.delim` or the like.

Let's convert the first column to a *factor*. To do so, I show a
special function from the *magrittr* package called a compound
assignment pipe. This looks like `%<>%`. This take the left-hand side
and performs the function on the right-hand side, finally re-assigning
the end result to the left-hand side. 

We will see other "pipes" from *magrittr* later on.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
orgs$type %<>% factor
```

Let's make some plots of the number of basepairs in the genomes of
these organisms, split by the type of organism. There's one plant with
a really large genome. The `bigpar` command makes the labels really
large, which is advisable for making plots for slides or posters.

```{r stripplots}
library(rafalib)
bigpar()
with(orgs, stripplot(bp ~ type))
with(orgs, stripplot(log10(bp) ~ type))
```

Most of the organisms have around 1 billion basepairs in their genome.

That large genome is wheat.

```{r}
orgs[which.max(orgs$bp),]
```

Let's remove it for now to make plots where we can see the range of
the other organisms.

I plot the number of genes that code for proteins over the total
number of basepairs:

```{r scatterbase}
orgs <- orgs[orgs$name != "Wheat",]
with(orgs, plot(bp, coding, col=type, pch=20, cex=2))
legend("topright", levels(orgs$type), col=1:nlevels(orgs$type), pch=20)
# right click to Esc from identify()
# with(orgs, identify(bp, coding, labels=orgs$name)) 
```

Another way to make a plot with labels is using 
[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/):

```{r scattergg}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(orgs, aes(bp, coding, color=type)) +
  geom_point(size=3)
```

Which organisms have the largest genome (after wheat)?

```{r}
orgs[order(orgs$bp, decreasing=TRUE)[1:5],c("name","bp")]
```

For many operations, it's useful to use the dplyr package to
manipulate *data.frames* or *tibbles*. 

Before, I introduce two new functions.  First, the forward pipe
`%>%`, which sends the left-hand side to the first argument of the
function on the right-hand side. Seconds, the right assignment `->` is
just like the more familiar left assignment, but points in the same
direction of the pipes, so I find useful here.

A simple example of the pipe is:

```{r}
c(1:9,1000) %>% mean(trim=.1)
```

Using dplyr, let's show, adding a new column
which tallies up the number of coding and non-coding genes:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
orgs %>% mutate(genes = coding + noncoding) -> orgs
orgs$genes
```

dplyr is really useful for grouping and summarization tasks. The
following line groups the organisms by type and summarizes the number
for each type, the mean ratio of genes which are coding and the
standard deviation of the ratio.

```{r}
orgs %>% group_by(type) %>% summarize(n=n(),
                                      cr.avg=mean(coding/genes),
                                      cr.sd=sd(coding/genes))
```

Let's save this as a new table, `tab`:

```{r}
orgs %>% group_by(type) %>% summarize(n=n(),
                                      cr.avg=mean(coding/genes),
                                      cr.sd=sd(coding/genes)) -> tab
```

Two packages with functions for printing tables (as Latex or
markdown):

```{r}
library(xtable)
xtable(tab)
library(knitr)
kable(tab)
```

We can use summarization as a mid-point and then send those summaries
to a plotting function. For example, points and line ranges:

```{r pointrange}
# here we have to name the median something other than `bp`
orgs %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarize(basepairs=median(bp),
            min=min(bp),
            max=max(bp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(type, basepairs, ymin=min, ymax=max)) +
  geom_pointrange()
```

ggplot2 is great for grouping points together with summarizing
graphical elements, such as lines through sets of points:

```{r linesummary}
ggplot(orgs, aes(bp, coding, col=type)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method="lm")
```

Also for "faceting" plots, breaking into multiple scatter plots by
breaking along a variable:

```{r faceting}
ggplot(orgs, aes(bp, coding)) +
  geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ type, scales="free")
```

Finally, I like to show a useful plot constructed using ggplot2, just
with simulated data. It is common that wants to show overlapping
densities or histograms, which is not a simple task with base R
graphics. It's fairly simple with ggplot2.

We create some simulated data drawing three sets of samples from three
distributions. 

```{r}
ns <- c(1000,500,200)
dat <- data.frame(type=rep(letters[1:3], ns),
                  z=rnorm(1700,
                          mean=rep(c(0,2,4),ns),
                          sd=rep(c(1,1,1),ns)))
head(dat)
table(dat$type)
```

It's straightforward to draw these as overlapping densities:

```{r ggdensity}
ggplot(dat, aes(z, col=type, fill=type)) + geom_density(alpha=0.1)
```

Or as histograms:

```{r gghist}
ggplot(dat, aes(z, col=type, fill=type)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.1, position="identity")
```

Another option, putting the bars beside each other:

```{r gghistdodge}
ggplot(dat, aes(z, col=type, fill=type)) +
  geom_histogram(position="dodge")
```
